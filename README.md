# Facebook-Screenshot-Bot
MentionMe( btw, still working on the name, lol ) is a Facebook bot that captures screenshots of posts when the bot is mentioned in comments and automatically replies with the screenshot. The bot is built using Python with Flask for handling webhooks and Selenium for taking screenshots.
